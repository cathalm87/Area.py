# Drone Project
Parrot AR 2.0 Drone

For this project, we were asked to program a drone to fly autonomously while being able to detect a marker. 
This report will go through the different steps taken in order to achieve this. We hope that this document will 
provide others with a guide on how best to approach similar projects. 
The document will provide a combination of detailed descriptions along with some snippets of code used in each of 
these steps taken. For this project, we were given the AR Parrot Drone 2.0 to work with.
